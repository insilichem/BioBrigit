BioBrigit: Prediction of protein metal-binding sites and mobility pathways
===============

BioBrigit is a computational tool designed for the prediction of protein-metal
binding sites in proteins. It uses a novel scoring function powered by
a deep learning model and previous domain knowledge regarding bioinorganic
interactions.

The deep learning model used is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that
interprets the physico-chemical environment. The previous domain knowledge is 
based on the works by [SÃ¡nchez-Aparicio et al. (2017)](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c74de1469df46a86f44378), and translates into the 
use of statistics to score the suitability of a point of space based on its 
relative position to certain atoms in the protein backbone.

Features
--------
**Diferent options for customizing the search:**

* Search for binding sites of specific metals.
* Filter results according to how likely they are to bind metals.
* Takes into account binding with backbone nitrogens and oxygens.
* Scanning the whole protein, though, a region can also be provided as input (in PDB format).

**Modular design:**

* The modular design of this package allows for its use as a command-line tool or to be integrated into a larger Python program or pipeline.

**Possible applications:**

* Screening of a pool of `.pdb` structures.
* Identification of conformational changes that alter the formation of metal-binding sites.
* Identification of probable paths that the metals might have to traverse before reaching the more stable, final, binding site.
* Metalloenzyme design.
* Metallodrug design.

Installation
------------
The recommended environment for using BioBrigit takes advatange of GPU acceleration. However, it is possible to use the tool in CPU-only environments.

The first step is to create an environment with the necessary libraries. Some will bee directly installed from source.

```bash
> conda create -n {name} python=3.9
> conda activate {name}
> pip install git+https://github.com/Acellera/moleculekit
> pip install git+https://github.com/RaulFD-creator/biobrigit
> conda install pdb2pqr -c acellera -c conda-forge
> pip install scikit-learn
```

**2.1. Environment set-up with CUDA acelleration**

The last step is to install the deep learning framework:

```bash
> conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda -c pytorch -c nvidia
> conda install pytorch-lightning tensorboard torchmetrics -c conda-forge
```

**2.2. Environment set-up without CUDA acelleration**

If no CUDA device is available, the recommended installation of the deep learning framework is:

```bash
> conda install pytorch
> conda install pytorch-lightning tensorboard torchmetrics -c conda-forge
```

Usage
-----
Once the environment is properly set-up the use of the program is relatively simple. The easiest example is:

```bash
> biobrigit target metal
```

There are many parameters that can be also tuned, though default use is reccomended.

* `--model`: Which CNN model is to be used. Two options available `BrigitCNN` which is the default model with highest performance and `TinyBrigit`, which is a smaller model for improved computational efficiency, though it has demonstrated lower performance.
* `--device`: Whether to use GPU acceleration (`cuda`) or not (`cpu`). By default, it uses GPU if available.
* `--device_id`: which of the available GPU devices should be used for the calculations. In case a given system has more than one GPU available. By default, it uses the device labelled as 0.
* `--outputfile`: Name of the outputfiles. The file extensions (`.txt` and `.pdb`) will be added automatically.
* `--max_coordinators`: Number of maximum coordinators expected. By default, 2. It only affects the range of values assigned to the probes.
* `--residues`: Number of most likely coordinating residues. By default, 10.
* `--stride`: Step at which the voxelized representation of the protein should be parsed. By default, 1. The greater the stride, the greater the computational efficiency; however, the resolution of the predictions will be affected.
* `--pH`: pH of the medium at which the structure is to be evaluated. By default, 7.4.
* `--cluster_radius`: Radius of the clusters to be generated in armstrongs. By default, 5.
* `--cnn_threshold`: Threshold for considering CNN points as possible coordinations. Lower values will impact computational efficiency; greater values, may hide possible coordinating regions. By default, 0.5. Values should be within the range [0, 1].
* `--combined_threshold`: Threshold for considering predictions combining BioMetAll and CNN scores as positive. By default, 0.5. Values should be within the range [0, 1].
* `--voxelsize`: Resolution of the 3D representation. In Arnstrongs. By default, 1 A.
* `--cnn_weight`: Importance of the CNN score in the final score in relations to the BioMetAll score. By default, 0.5. Values should be within the range [0, 1].
* `--verbose`: Information that will be displayed. 0: Only Moleculekit, 1: All. By default, 1.
* `--residue score`: Scoring function for residue coordination analysis. Can be either `discrete`, that only considers how likely is a residue to bind to a certain metal (more computationally efficient); or `gaussian`, that also considers the fitness of the geometrical descriptors for a certain residue and metal. By default, `gaussian`.
* `--threads`: Number of threads available for multithreading calculation. By default it will create 2 threads per physical core.

**Examples:**

Searching for copper.

```bash
> biobrigit 1dhy Cu
```

Searching with generic metal.

```bash
> biobrigit 1dhy General --outputfile 1dhy_general
````

Fast preliminar exploration for binding sites with 4 coordinations, no GPU, and only considering the 4 most likely coordinating residues.

```bash
> biobrigit 1dhy Cu --stride 2 --model TinyBrigit --max_coordinators 4 --device cpu --residues 4
```

Search for small clusters at acidic pH (5.2).

```bash
> biobrigit 1dhy Cu --cluster_radius 3 --pH 5.2
```
